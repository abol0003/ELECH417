\section{Question - Wireshark Analysis}

\begin{questionBox}{Wireshark Analysis}
    Start a Wireshark capture on the trunk line (between both switches) then analyze the ping between two PCs that are on different switches but on the same VLAN (e.g. PC1-PC2 or PC3-PC4). Stop the capture, look for ICMP echo ping packets and click on it. For this packet, open the 802.1Q header (between L2 and L3) and validate that the tag ID is 20 (or 30). Put a Wireshark screenshot with the tag ID highlighted.
