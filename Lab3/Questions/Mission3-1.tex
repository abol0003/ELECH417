\section{Question - Inter-VLAN pinging}

\begin{questionBox}{Inter-VLAN pinging}
    Why does the ping from PC1 to PC4 is working even if they are on different VLAN ? With wireshark, monitor the stick line (i.e. connection between Switch1 and Router) when pinging and deduce what is happening. What is the path taken by the packet and the tag (i.e. VLAN number) associated to the packet at each hop ? What is the impact on the bandwidth ?
