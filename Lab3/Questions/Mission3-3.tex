\section{Question - General conclusion}

\begin{questionBox}{General conclusion}
    Explain briefly the whole lab (VLAN, isolation and trunking). To show that you have clearly understood the lab, make a schema of the physical and logical topology obtained after mission 2, and the topology after mission 3. You can use software such as draw.io or take a clean picture of a schema on paper. If you schemas are clear enough, you do not need to explain them but you can if you are unsure.
